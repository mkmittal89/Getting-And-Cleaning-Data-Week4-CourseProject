## Description
The .R file generates a tidy data set containing avergage of each feature mentioned below which are grouped by each subject's specific 
activity. The base data set is obtained from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" study from this 
[URL](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The tidy data set (output) contains 180 rows (6 activities for 30 subjects) and 82 features that contain 'activityId', 
'SubjectID', 'activityType' or start with 'mean' or 'std' in the 
original data set.  

•mean(): Mean value  
•std(): Standard deviation  

## Grouping

As mentioned above the base data is grouped by the following values:  
•subject - The ID of the test subject  
•activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken  

## Activity

Following are the six activities identified by their associated numbers. There are 30 subjects identified by numbers 1 to 30 as well.

1.WALKING  
2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
4.SITTING  
5.STANDING  
6.LAYING
